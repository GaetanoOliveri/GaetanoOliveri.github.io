            <p id="about-me" class="center">
                My name is Gaetano Oliveri and I am a Sophomore at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg,
                VA. I am currently a chemical engineering student with a GPA of 3.3. My primary interest is in
                an engineering assignment that will allow me to demonstrate and apply my learnings from my curriculum as
                well as my leadership and core skills that I have developed in athletics and the building trades. Throughout my life I
                have always been fascinated with problem solving and the corresponding satisfaction in developing and building
                solutions. For example, during the summers of 2020 and 2021 I was given the opportunity to work with a construction crew
                that built foundations for homes. This allowed me to begin to see practical engineering in a real setting while also
                seeing the fruits of my hard work realized. While in high school I was part of the robotics team where I saw first hand
                the aspects of design and development as part of that team. I enjoyed thinking about the design of our robot
                and the challenge of taking that design and creating a working bot. That was really both a challenge and a lot of fun!
                Finally, I was also the co-captain of our swim team where I had the chance to lead and motivate my teammates in
                competition. Thank you for your time and consideration.
